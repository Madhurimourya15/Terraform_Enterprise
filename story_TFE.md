🌱 Story: Building a City with Terraform Enterprise

👉 Imagine your company is building a big city (infrastructure) with houses, offices, and roads.

1. The Architects (Users / Developers)
👷 The architects (developers) draw blueprints (Terraform code).
--> They save these blueprints in GitHub/GitLab (version control system).

2. The City Office (Terraform Enterprise Platform)
🏢 Instead of each architect building on their own, they submit their designs to the City Office (TFE Platform).

The City Office has:
--> Workspaces → Separate departments (Dev, Test, Prod) handling different neighborhoods.
--> Execution Environment → A safe place where designs are tested before construction.
--> State Management → Central record of what’s already built (so no one builds on the same land twice).
--> Policies (Sentinel) → City rules (e.g., “No skyscrapers taller than 10 floors in Dev area”).
--> Private Module Registry → A catalog of standard house designs (modules) that everyone can reuse.

3. The Inspection Team (Integrations)
👮 Before any house is built, the Inspection Team checks the blueprints.
--> VCS (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps) → Tracks changes in designs.
--> CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) → Automate testing and approvals.

4. The Builders (Cloud Infrastructure)
👷 Once approved, the Builders (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes) actually construct the houses, offices, and roads based on the Terraform plans.

🌎 Story Summary (Interview Way)
👉 Developers write Terraform code (blueprints) → push to GitHub → Terraform Enterprise (City Office) manages workspaces, policies, and state → Integrations check rules → Finally, Cloud providers (Builders) construct the infrastructure.
