ðŸŒ± Easy Explanation of Terraform Enterprise Architecture

Terraform Enterprise is built with 4 main layers:

1. User Layer (Developers/Operators)
--> Developers write Terraform code.
-->Push code to GitHub/GitLab.

2. Application Layer (Terraform Enterprise Platform)
--> Workspaces â†’ Separate state & runs for dev, test, prod.
--> Execution Environment â†’ Secure containers run Terraform plan/apply.
--> State Management â†’ Centralized, secure, locked.
--> Policies (Sentinel) â†’ Ensure compliance (rules before apply).
--> Private Module Registry â†’ Share reusable code inside company.

3. Integration Layer
--> VCS (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps) â†’ triggers runs on code changes.
--> CI/CD Tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).

4. Infrastructure Layer (Cloud/On-Prem)
--> Actual infra created â†’ AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.

ðŸŒŽ Interview One-Line Summary

ðŸ‘‰ Terraform Enterprise provides a central platform where developers push Terraform code, it runs securely in workspaces with policies and approvals, manages state centrally, and then provisions infrastructure across clouds.
